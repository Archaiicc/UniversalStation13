changes:
  - tweak: Field disperser now plays sound that ignores pressure. That means you will
      hear it regardless of it being in space.
  - tweak: Limb dismemberment now plays a sound.
  - tweak: Bashing against a window is now louder.
  - soundadd: Added sounds from /tg/ for limb dismemberment.

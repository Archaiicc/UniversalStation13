changes:
  - balance: Antidexafen no longer overdoses, and its painkiller amount has been decreased
      to 5, from 15. Neither of these are very big at all, so overall impact should
      be low.
  - tweak: Lactate renamed to Lactic Acid, to avoid... confusion.
  - tweak: Gave Imidazoline a proper description.

changes:
  - bugfix: Cameras no longer permanently block blob expansion.
  - tweak: Blobs will no longer spread onto tiles that have a dense object, which
      blocked them from being shot by projectiles.
  - tweak: Blobs will now damage any items or objects on a turf that use standardized
      health.

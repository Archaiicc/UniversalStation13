changes:
  - rscadd: Revamped the way changeling abilities are shown. Instead of existing in
      a verb tab, they now have buttons like spells. Actual functionality should remain
      (mostly) unchanged.
  - tweak: Changeling stasis will now send a message and sound to the user if they're
      dead and have ghosted, allowing them to know when to return to their body.
  - tweak: Rewrote the messages for a bunch of changeling abilities.
  - tweak: Improved the user feedback for some changeling abilities.
  - tweak: Changeling stasis and other fake death sources are now more convincing.
      Examine texts, medical scanners, medical HUDs, and other sources are now fooled
      by fake death, and fake-dead mobs will no longer gasp or make other emotes.
  - balance: You will now receive a message if you fail to speak while silenced, instead
      of it failing with no feedback.
  - balance: Monkeyizing is a little faster.
  - balance: Medical HUDs will now detect changelings in stasis as being dead, rather
      than alive.
  - balance: Because the AI role doesn't currently exist, Digital Camouflage has been
      made free to purchase and maintain, as it is primary a roleplay ability now.

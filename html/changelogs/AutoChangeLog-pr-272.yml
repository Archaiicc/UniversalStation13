changes:
  - tweak: Vox traders(NPC) now always want to purchase human mobs. Living players
      cost more.
  - tweak: Appraise verb, available to players with Finance skills, now can be used
      on almost anything around you. You can finally tell your coworkers how much
      they'd cost on the black market, yay!

changes:
  - tweak: Flashes no longer stack their confusion / stun effects infinitely.
  - bugfix: Groins are now more pain resistant.
  - balance: Dislocations via disarm intent are significantly less likely to occur
      with low force weapons initially, chance to dislocate rises as damage is dealt
      to limbs.

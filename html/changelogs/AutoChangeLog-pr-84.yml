  - rscadd: Items in Xenowear now list the names of each species that can equip them.
  - tweak: Special examine texts for species now appear below their clothing information,
      instead of being at the top of the message, and are italicized for clarity.
  - tweak: Adherents now have a uniform layer, which they need to equip an ID and
      a belt. They also get pockets now, as a result.
  - tweak: Adherents can now equip the gear harness, and pick it as a loadout item
      in Xenowear.

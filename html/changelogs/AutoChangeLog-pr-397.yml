  - rscadd: You may now become addicted to certain drugs if you've been taking them
      for long enough. Becoming addicted is done by gaining addiction points from
      doing drugs in a specific category; If you become addicted, you can stop being
      addicted by lowering your addiction points until it reaches a low enough value(i.e.
      by not taking drugs). Most addictions will have withdraval effects, however.

changes:
  - tweak: Adherents now have a special cell, called the "crystal-ceramic grid", instead
      of a standard superior power cell. It is mechanically identical, but shows instead
      of "superior power cell" when you recharge from an electron reservoir.
  - tweak: The electron reservoir now has first-person messages towards the person
      using it. Zap.
  - bugfix: Slamming someone into the electron reservoir now drops the grab, since
      the victim goes flying across the room.

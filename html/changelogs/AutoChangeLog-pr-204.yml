changes:
  - rscadd: Slippery motor oil is now available to emagged janitor cyborgs.
  - tweak: Water/Lube stun durations are heavily nerfed so you won't spend 10 seconds
      lying on the floor.
  - tweak: The wet floor overlays don't become invisible every once in a while now,
      making it easier to spot a wet/lubed floor.

				<li class="tweak">Forehead graffiti is now removable by using a piece of paper targeting the head.</li>

			<h2 class="date">13 July 2021</h2>
			<h3 class="author"> updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Adds Fleet Jackets and Polo and Pants back to the uniform vendors.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Ilysen updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Microwaves are no longer used to cook recipes. Instead, they're used to cook ingredient items, such as raw cutlets, in bulk.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using monkey cubes in the worst way now also fractures your chest, in addition to having a beefier message and a splat sound.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the electric stove, which is the new machine used to cook recipes. It cooks a bit faster than the microwave (to make up for there only being one of them) and can be upgraded with stock parts.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added an electric stove to the Torch galley and several offships.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hot plates (smaller versions of the stove) to places that currently only have a microwave that now lack an object to cook food, including most of the other offships not mentioned above.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added baking sheets, which are large trays that can be put into stoves or hot plates while they have food on them to cook the ingredients on them as though they were standalone. For instance, you can put the ingredients for a taco onto a sheet, and the ingredients for meatbread into the stove, and both a taco and a loaf of meatbread will be cooked! They can only hold anything that could normally fit into a stove.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">All players now have access to a "Mentorhelp" verb, which allows you to request help from an in-game mentor similar to an adminhelp.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mentors can respond to a player's mentorhelp by clicking on their name (players can reply to a mentor in the same way) and can also initiate the conversation by either right-clicking a mob or in the "Mentor PM" verb.</li>
				<li class="admin">Msay has received an overhaul and now stands for mentorsay, not moderatorsay. Mentors have access to it by default. Admins retain access.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All of the verbs listed above, as well as adminhelp, asay, admin PM, and staffwho are now in a new "Staffhelp" category for easier access.</li>
				<li class="admin">Admin memos have been moved to an "Admin Memos" verb, and a new "Mentor Memos" verb has been added with nearly-identical functionality. They both reside in the Admin verb category. Mentors cannot edit or delete mentor memos or see admin memos.</li>
				<li class="admin">Mentor action logs (mentorhelps and PMs) can be viewed in the Secrets panel.</li>
				<li class="admin">Two new config settings have been added, LOG_MENTOR and ENABLE_MEMOS. The former acts similarly to LOG_ADMIN, and the latter will enable/disable the use of the memo systems (though the verbs will still be visible).</li>
				<li class="admin">Admins can mute people from using mentorhelps and mentor PMs.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">You can now repair damage to gas canisters with duct tape.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Examining a gas canisters now gives a rough idea of how damaged it is.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Improved the feedback for attacking canisters - it now has a normal attack animation and plays a sound.</li>
				<li class="tweak">By making canisters rupture at zero health instead of 10, they're technically slightly stronger now!</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Updated the codex entry for canisters to reflect new functionalities.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Renamed canisters - now they're `gas canister` instead of `Canister`. Also added a simple examine description.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Helium, Methyl Bromide, and Chlorine canisters now explicitly state what they contain on their label instead of having a chemical formula - this is to bring them in line with other gas canisters.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The chef's cookers (griddle, oven, etc.) have received a UI facelift.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Cookers now properly play a ding when they finish cooking - previously the sound played at 0.5% volume.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adherents now have a special cell, called the "crystal-ceramic grid", instead of a standard superior power cell. It is mechanically identical, but shows instead of "superior power cell" when you recharge from an electron reservoir.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The electron reservoir now has first-person messages towards the person using it. Zap.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Slamming someone into the electron reservoir now drops the grab, since the victim goes flying across the room.</li>
